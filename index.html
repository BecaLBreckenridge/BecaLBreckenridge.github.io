		<p> Growing up on a small family farm has led me to appreciate all that agriculture has to offer. My past has greatly influenced why I chose to be part of the future of agriculture.</p>
		<p> I grew up about 30 miles outside of Memphis in the town of Brighton, TN. I grew up as a middle child of three, with both an older and younger sister. My older sister is now married  and has a little girl and another one on the way, and my younger sister is a student at the University of Memphis. I was raised on a small family farm, and I showed livestock for 10 years, which consisted of a flock of Natural Colored Lincolns. This is what really sparked my interest in agriculture. Now that I am attending school, I took a break from the farm life to focus on building a future through agricultural communications.</p>	
		<p> Agriculture communications was not always the plan when I was thinking about a career path. In fact, I had always envisioned myself teaching high school agriculture. I love teaching future generations about agriculture because they are our future. </p>
		<p> At the beginning of my junior year of college, I had a change of heart. I wanted to be able to express my love for agriculture in more ways than just teaching. I wanted to have the opportunity to be on the radio with agriculture news, or to be able to write articles for the various Farm and Livestock magazines. Choosing agricultural communications gave me the choice as to what I want to do with my career.  </p>
		<p> I have taken many radio and broadcasting courses here at the University of Tennessee at Martin and this is a new aspect of communications I never thought I would get to experience. I also still enjoy reading my monthly agriculture magazines as well as the daily scroll through social media outlets. Communications is a broad range of resources that I never realized had such an impact on our everyday lives. </p>
		<p> A few of the things that I enjoy are the outdoors, traveling, and my miniature poodles Bear and Piper. In the summer, you can find me floating down the river in a kayak or hanging out with friends at the Kentucky Lake. I also enjoy taking a few beach trips when I get the chance. In the fall and winter, you will find me in the mountains riding side by sides with friends and family. Every day you can find me with my dogs either enjoying the pretty weather with a walk or relaxing with a movie at the house. </p>
		<p> My future is now up for interpretation. I have been accepted into The University of Missouri Graduate Program and will be moving to Columbia Missouri in January of 2020. I plan to further my education in agriculture and potentially teach agriculture communications at the higher education level. I will spend two years in Missouri gaining necessary knowledge and teaching experience needed to be successful in the higher education level. </p>
